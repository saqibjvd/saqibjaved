          Beast of Exmoor - In British folklore, the beast is a phantom cat said to roam the fields of Exmoor in Devon and Somerset in the United Kingdom.Sightings of the Beast of Exmoor were first reported in the 1970s, although the period of its notoriety began in 1983, when a South Molton farmer named Eric Ley claimed to have lost over a hundred sheep in the space of three months, all of them apparently killed by violent throat injuries. There was even a report of the Beast seen fishing with its paw into the River Barle at Simonsbath, whilst some locals theorised that its lair might be in old mine workings on the Moor.

        BigFoot - People claim to have seen Bigfoot, describing it as a large, hairy, muscular, bipedal ape-like creature, roughly 6â€“9 feet, covered in hair described as black, dark brown, or dark reddish. About one-third of all claims of Bigfoot sightings are located in the Pacific Northwest, with the remaining reports spread throughout the rest of North America. Most reports are considered mistakes or hoaxes, even by those researchers who say that Bigfoot exists.The debate over the legitimacy of Bigfoot sightings reached a peak in the 1970s.

        The Jersey Devil (also known as the Leeds Devil) is a legendary creature said to inhabit the Pine Barrens of South Jersey. The creature is often described as a flying biped with hooves, but there are many variations. The common description is that of a bipedal kangaroo-like or wyvern-like creature with a horse- or goat-like head, leathery bat-like wings, horns, small arms with clawed hands, legs with cloven hooves, and a forked tail. During the week of January 16 through 23, 1909, newspapers of the time published hundreds of claimed encounters with the Jersey Devil from all over the state. Among alleged encounters publicized that week were claims the creature "attacked" a trolley car in Haddon Heights and a social club in Camden.
